            We'll make some happy little bushes here. Everyone is going to see
            things differently - and that's the way it should be. Put it in, leave
            it alone. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your
            entire perspective. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my
            coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. That easy.
            <br />

            Let's get wild today. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're
            a Cheechako. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. It's
            amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. These little
            son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out.
            It is a lot of fun.
            <br />
            <br />I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Use your
            imagination, let it go. Don't forget to tell these special people in
            your life just how special they are to you.
